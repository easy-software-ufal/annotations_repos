    Change InjectorImpl.callInContext to InjectorImpl.enterContext to reduce stack
    depth on common injection paths.
    
    This should save 2 stack frames per 'top level injection' and also we no longer need to allocate the ContextualCallable object.
    
    In a simple benchmark that injects a chain of 5 @Provides bindings and 5 ConstructorInjector bindings I saw the following improvements.
    
    Before:      time ns | objects
    provides     319.193 | 23
    constructor  322.787 | 23
    
    After:       time ns | objects
    provides     292.654 | 22
    constructor  295.167 | 22
    
    So ~a 8% improvement in provisioning time and one fewer allocation.

    Make sure to hold the lock when inspecting jitBindings in loadEagerSingletons.
    
    loadEagerSingletons needs to copy all the jit bindings into a list in order to safely iterate them, however it still needs to hold the lock while performing the copy. Without this you can get ConcurrentModificationExceptions, or things like "constructor not ready" errors because partially constructed bindings can be shared across threads.
    
    I added a test that can trigger this failure mode, prior to the fix the test is ~30% flaky, after it passes consistently.

    Remove ProvisionListener.ProvisionInvocation.getDependencyChain() and associated data structures from the internal build.
    
    Also, deprecate DependencyAndSource which should have been deprecated at the same time as getDependencyChain().
    
    These APIs are planned for removal from the open source build in Guice 4.4.
    
    In order to support cyclic proxy generation in SingletonScope we maintain the setDependency() API just for use by InternalFactoryToProviderAdapter.  This will ensure that SingletonScope can continue to detect proxy-able dependencies while not imposing the cost of updating this field in all cases.  In the future it might make sense to move this feature directly into SingletonScope by modifying the adapter factory we generate for singleton scope.
    
    Benchmarks Results:

    We save at least 1 allocation + 88 bytes for the stack data structure and cut ~10% off the time of any single provision. for provisioning chains that require traversing more than one factory these savings will accumulate.  e.g. timeLinkedBindings is a set of linked bindings 5 deep and has a ~30% reduction in overhead.

    Remove the dependency on InternalContext.getDependencyChain() from SingletonScope
    
    This method is going away and this is the only internal use of it in guice (outside of tests).  It is used to construct error messages by listing the dep chains from other
    threads involved in singleton based lock cycles.
    
    There is no direct replacement, so instead we are using a completely different
    error message formatting using thread stacks.
    
    For each thread in the cycle we will print something like:
    
    Thread['foo',5,main] is holding locks the following singletons in the cycle:
    com.google.Foo
    com.google.Bar annotated with com.google.inject.name.Named(hello)
    at com.google.inject.internal.SingletonScope.provision
    at ....
    at com.google.application.package.Foo.createInjector
    
    and then for the thread who detected the cycle we will report the current
    provisioning stack (as normal).
    
    While this loses some detail from the other threads, it does add the full stack trace which should be useful for identifying the top level call that triggered the failure.
    
    To do this i had to slightly modify the contract on CycleDetectingLock to make sure that the final lock in the cycle was reported

    Add getEntries(Iterable) to MapBinderBinding
    
    This change is motivated by ModuleTester.assertMappedKey.
    Previously there was no good way to determine the K keys
    that were actually bound in the MapBinder. ModuleTester
    relied upon implementation details in RealMapBinder to
    do the assert, but that is not good. By providing this
    new method, it will provide ModuleTester, and others, a
    better way to investigate MapBindings.
    
    A change to ModuleTester to use this new method will
    follow in a later CL.

    Switch multibinder to use an ImmutableSet instead of a LinkedHashSet
    
    The prior implementation was based on the theory that presizing the set was
    more important than the particular implementation.  This of course, is not
    true!  LinkedHashSet internally uses a LinkedHashMap so every insertion
    allocates Map.Entry objects even though they are never needed via the Set
    interface.  ImmutableSet avoids this altogether and also allows us to avoid
    needing the unmodifiable wrapper.  Overall this saves one allocation per
    multibinder element and in addition to some fixed overhead.
    
    The major complication to this design is detecting duplicates.

    Rewrite RealMapBinder to use InternalFactory
    
    This CL is a performance refactor.
    
    This does change the SPI dependency tree, in a way I believe more accurately
    describes the dependencies of each of the maps provided. Previously the dependencies for all maps was just a dependency on the entrySetBinder, which contained providers for all of the values. The new implementation has dependencies directly on the Vs for Map<K, V> and the multimap versions (e.g. Map<K, Set<V>>), and dependencies on Provider<V> for Map<K, Provider<V>> and the mutimap versions (e.g. Map<K, Set<Provider<V>>>).
    
    This implementation follows the same pattern as OptionalBinder, notably
    * All the mutable state is moved into a new inner class named BindingSelection
    * Calculating keys + set names is delayed until configure()/initialization time
    * None of the factories need circular deps resolution
    
    Caliper benchmarks show an improvement in all four bindings provided by
    MapBinder:

    This has been run on the tap train and no failures are believed to be
    associated with this CL:

    Speed up ProviderMethodsModule.getProviderMethods.
    
    Test profiling at google shows this method taking large amounts of time.  While the profile results do not provide very detailed data, from examining collected stack traces we can see that it is likely due to calculating the generic signatures of all the methods.  To improve this I have
    
    * short circuited scanning for overrides for any type >= the super-most type that declared a provider method.  This will prevent us from calculating signatures for AbstractModule
    * don't calculate any signatures for classes that don't define provider methods
    * micro optimizations to avoid allocating data structures we likely don't need. since many modules don't define any provider methods
    * make the common ModuleAnnotatedMethodScanner cache the annotations set to
      avoid generating a bunch of garbage
    
    I don't have a great way to validate that this actually improves the
    performance problem reported, since the data gathering methodology is pretty
    ad-doc.  But this should reduce the overall amount of work we are doing.

    Run google-java-format on all Guice code.
    
    configure a presubmit to ensure that it stays formatted.
    
    Highlights include:
    * simplified import order
    * method annotations are now consistently defined on the preceding line
    * javadoc reformatted to 100 chars column width
    
    One test that contained line numbers in error messages had to be modified and
    the formatter didn't like some of the more complicated preprocessor directives
    (MOE and AOP).
    
    To avoid formatting the copyright notices as javadoc i did a preprocessing step to rewrite the initial '/**' to '/*' using perl

    Convert RealProviderMultimapProvider to use InternalFactory interfaces.
    
    This is a performance improvement CL. The goal is to avoid overhead of
    ProviderInstanceBinding + ProviderLookups, and instead use the
    InternalFactory interfaces directly. This will be one in a series of
    CLs to migrate all of RealMapBinder.

    Fix issues reported by errorprone
    
    99% of this is adding missing @Override annotations, in the long tail we also have
    
    * insert missing calls to Assert.fail() in tests that are testing exception behavior
    * rewrite a few cases of Foo.class.instanceof(c) to c instanceof Foo
    * rewrite Class.newInstance - > Class.getConstructor().newInstance() which doesn't break checked exception checking.
    * adding @javax.inject.Inject annotations to methods that override methods annotated with @javax.inject.Inject

    Deprecate ProvisionListener.ProvisionInvocation.getDependencyChain()
    
    A benchmarking experiment* shows that maintaining the dependency stack costs about 10% of guice performance.  Anecdotally this feature also isn't very popular, so eliminating it seems reasonable.

    A bunch of tiny optimizations based on profiling some common injector patterns.
    
    * instead of calling ProvisionListenerStackCallback.hasListeners() represent an
      empty callback as null.  This means instead of 3 reads to check, we do 1
      compare with null.
    * in MembersInjectorImpl instead of storing empty lists, store null instead,
      again this will make checking for empty (the common case) consume one fewer
      read.
    * unpack the BindingImpl in SingleParameterInjector to reduce indirection.
    * generally eliminate indirection and multiple field reads where possible

    Rewrite Multibinder to use the InternalFactory interfaces and avoid the overhead of normal ProviderInstanceBindings + ProviderLookups
    
    This implementation follows the same pattern as OptionalBinder, notably
    * All the mutable state is moved into a new inner class named BindingSelection
    * Calculating keys + set names is delayed until configure()/initialization time
    * None of the factories need circular deps resolution,
    
    I did my best to mirror the structure of RealOptionalBinder instead of trying to maintain the preexisting structure, since i thought that having RealMultibinder implement Provider and Module was a little strange.  Let me know what you think.
    
    Benchmark results
    This shows the cost of injection Set<T> and Collection<Provider<T>> for a multibinder containing 5 entries
    
    So we save 2 objects, 58 bytes and about 20ns per multibinder entry, which is less than i expected

    delete InstanceBindingImpl.getProvider() and use the default implementation from the base class.
    
    This will ensure that if someone (such as RealMultibinder.get()) calls Binding.getProvider().get() on an InstanceBindingImpl, the instance will be definitely initialized.

    Rewrite RealOptionalBinder to use the InternalFactory interfaces and avoid the overheads of normal ProviderInstanceBindings + Providers.
    
    A couple of notes on the implementation
    * all the mutable state (besides Binder) has been moved into a new helper object 'BindingSelection'.  I think by moving things into a helper object the interactions are a bit clearer.  This also allows us to make all the factories static.
    * calculating the keys + optional binder 'name' have been delayed until configure() time or until setDefault()/setBinding() is called.  I would assume that most optionalbinders are deduped or that setDefault()/setBinding() is not called, so we can avoid work in the common cases.
    * None of the factories need circular deps resolution because they simply delegate to other factories. (in this way they are much like the ProxyFactory used for LinkedKeyBindings, we just wrap the result in Optional)
    * I performed a minor refactoring the the java.util.Optional reflection helpers
    
    Benchmark results:
    timeOptionalBinderInjection measures how long to inject an object that depends on other OptionalBinders in every configuration
    timeProvidesInjection times how long it takes to inject an @Provides method
    timeOptionalBinderSetBinding times how long it takes to directly inject an OptionalBinder.setBinding() binding that delegates to the same bindings as 'timeProvidesInjection'.  So we should be able to see the overhead of OptionalBinder to fetch the same object.

    This CL resolves an issue found when a method in a subclass overrides a method from a superclass, where the superclass method is annotated with @javax.inject.Inject, while the subclass method is not. JSR-330 states that the injector should not trigger method injection when an instance of the subclass is injected.
    
    This cleanup is necessary to enable OverridesJavaxInjectableMethod as an error.

    For OptionalBinder based providers (and the other multibindings), not all provided bindings should implement ProviderWithExtensions visitor so having the base class implement it is inconvenient.

    Fix guice error messages that propagate across scope applications to remove redundant sources.
    
    Normally when guice adds sources to the current stack it checks for repetition, but in the special case of fixing up sources after the fact when catching a ProvisionException from a scoped provider this deduping wouldn't happen.  So a scoped @Provides method that throws an exception would get repeated at the top of the source stack

    Perform a number of micro-optimzations in guice
    
    * inline the InternalContext$DependencyStack object into DependencyStack (saves 1 allocation plus some bytes for object overhead)
    * change the implementation of InternalContext.constructionContexts to be an identity hash map.  This saves a bunch of time and allocation of HashMap$Node objects.
    * use indexed for-loops instead of for-each loops in MembersInjector to avoid iterator allocations
    * move a field read that is only used in error paths out of the common case in ConstructorInjector
    
    The major change is the switch from HashMap->IdentityHashMap.  I believe this helps a lot because
    1. there are no more calls to equals/hashCode
    2. there is no more allocation of node objects.  IdentityHashMap defers allocating these until .entrySet() is called (and we never call it), whereas HashMap does it all the time.
    3. more compact memory layout
    4. slightly larger initial size.

    When formatting method/constructor dependencies for error messages print the 'ordinal' of the parameter rather than the index.
    
    Given the method
    
      void foo(A a, B b) {}
    
    Guice currently prints "parameter 1 of foo" to refer to 'b', but most people (based on an informal survey), believe it refers to 'a'.  To resolve this confusion Guice will now print "the 2nd parameter of foo" to refer to 'b'.

    Add support for javax.inject.Provider for more MapBinder multimap bindings and change the multimap provider bindings to return collections instead of sets.
    
    Now when using MapBinder, you get the following bindings
      - Map<K, V>
      - Map<K, Provider<V>>
      - Map<K, javax.inject.Provider<V>>
      - Set<Map.Entry<K, Provider<V>>
      - Set<Map.Entry<K, javax.inject.Provider<V>> *new
    
    if you call permitDuplicates() you also get
     - Map<K, Set<V>>
     - Map<K, Set<Provider<V>>>
     - Map<K, Set<javax.inject.Provider<V>>> *new
     - Map<K, Collection<Provider<V>>> *new
     - Map<K, Collection<javax.inject.Provider<V>>> *new
    
    We should somehow deprecated/delete the Map<K, Set<Provider<V>>> bindings, I
    doubt there are many such users so depending on compatiblity contraints, it
    seems like it might be pretty straighforward.

    Respect @Nullable in BoundFieldModule.
    
    Fields annotated with some @Nullable annotation are allowed to have null values bound for testing, following how Guice works with null (https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/UseNullable)

    Remove globalInternalContext, store injector ref directly in SingletonScope
    
    SingletonScope currently uses globalInternalContext - a slow ConcurrentMap that
    needs to be updated on every call to InjectorImpl.callInContext() - to get
    ahold of the InternalContext object for the current thread / injector. This is
    the only use of globalInternalContext, aside from producing error messages.
    
    This patch modifies SingletonScope to fetch the relevant InternalContext
    directly, by storing a weak reference to the calling injector into the
    Singleton provider (via Scoping.scope()). This way, the singleton provider can
    still access the correct thread-specific InternalContext object, without
    InjectorImpl having to update globalInternalContext on every call to
    callInContext().
    
    This will degrade the error message somewhat, in the case where multithreaded
    singleton instantiation creates a circular deadlock.

    Add comment explaining InjectorImpl.localContext
    
    localContext holds an array rather than an object, because array operations are
    faster than ThreadLocal operations.
    
    localContext is typed Object[] rather than InternalContext[], in order to
    prevent classloader leaks in cases where the class / application is reloaded,
    but the thread itself is not killed, leaving alive ThreadLocal's reference to
    the localContext class.

    Try to make @Provides provisioning more like @Inject provisioning
    
    To do this i created a new BindingImpl + InternalFactory implementation for @Provides methods.  This was mostly modeled off of how ConstructorBindingImpl + ConstructorBindingImpl.Factory work (with ProviderMethod taking the place of ConstructorInjector).  This has the benefit of removing a bunch of overhead when @Provides methods construct their dependencies.
    
    Before this change there is a definite gap in performance between the @Inject and @Provides strategies.  After this change @Provides is actually faster than @Inject constructors.  I believe this is due to the fact that there is no MembersInjector involved and the circular proxy logic is slightly simpler (so i will definitely be looking at this next!).
    
    The overall benefit is simply due to
    1. eliminating the ProviderLookup wrappers
    2. eliminating the new InternalContext + InjectorImpl.callInContext for each @Provides invocation
    
    For future work i want to look into eliminating more of the object allocations.  Currently there are 31 for this benchmark.  The bare minimum is 5 (because that is how many objects are getting constructed).
    
    This cl saved 22 stack frames (~4 per @Provides method)

    Fix tests that intend to check that an error is thrown but don't.
    
    Tests of a testing API often look like this:
    
    	try {
    		runATestThatShouldFail();
    		fail();
    	} catch (AssertionError expected) {
    	}
    
    However, the catch() block can catch not only the expected failure from runATestThatShouldFail() but also the "test did not fail when it should have" failure from fail().

    Fix the visibility predicates that are used to decide whether or not to use FastClass in guice.
    
    Due to a bug in cglib, Guice has avoided using fastclass for non public constructors and for protected @Provides methods.  The cglib bug was fixed in cglib 3.2 (recently added to guice).  Also, stop reusing the Visibility.forMember helper to calculate the classloader for FastClass instances.  Visibility.forMember was geared towards AOP usecases where cglib is used to generate a subclass.  FastClass doesn't work that way so I don't believe the predicate make sense and instead I essentially hardcoded SAME_PACKAGE.
    
    Finally, avoid using FastConstructor/FastMethod in a few places to save some stack frames/method calls

    Allowing two member injections happen in parallel.
    
    Initializer explicitly forbade using several threads
    with a single CountDownLatch.
    With this change there is no single lock for
    InjectableReferences. Each one still employs
    double locking to guarantee thread-safety and
    exactly once contract.
    
    As a side effect of this change:
    - requestInjection() explicitly checks that
      validateOutstandingInjections() were not called
      to simplify state reasoning
    - requestInjection() stores all requested
      injections in a list to enforce initialization
      ordering similar to static injections
    - potential for a deadlock when client uses several threads
      to initialize InjectableReferences
      with circular dependencies

    Bug: CycleDetectingLockFactory could dead lock.
    
    When several instances of a CycleDetectingLockFactory
    are used they could deadlock each other as they
    don't share locks information between each other.
    
    This is fixed by using shared storage for
    all factories instances.

    Implement more granular locks for a Singleton scope in Guice.
    
    Now when you can create two independent singletons using
    the same injector in different threads.
    This make it easy to create scopes creating singletons using
    thread pools with all the concurrency being done by Guice.
    As a nice side effect Singleton scope is no longer treated
    specially in Guice codebase.
    
    The obvious problem to solve is potential deadlocks:
    A requires B, B requires C, C requires A where all are
    singletons and all are created simultaneously.
    It's impossible to detect this deadlock using information
    within one thread, so we have to have a shared storage.
    
    An idea is to have a map of creators' locks and a map
    of which threads are waiting for other singletons to be created.
    Using this information circular dependencies are trivially
    discovered within O(N) where N is a number of concurrent threads.
    
    Important to not that no other deadlock scenarios within
    Guice code is introduced as Guice does not expose any
    other scopes that can span several threads.
    
    Now it would be possible for
    client code to deadlock on itself with two lazy singletons
    calling each other's providers during creation.
    This is deemed as a non-issue as it is up to the client
    to write a thread-safe code.

    Some work on issue 910 -- ensure that anonymous keys & typeliterals don't
    retain references to their parent classes.  Still some more work to do in
    WeakKeySet to let it clean up more frequently, but this should help for now.

    Further fixes for https://github.com/google/guice/issues/904 -- java8 generates
    default methods for subclasses when they override generic methods with the more
    specific type.
    
    We use a two-tiered approach to fixing: (1) try to use MethodHandles + unreflectSpecial, which lets us call default method implementations directly, and if that doesn't work then (2) try to map default methods to compatible method signatures that could be the overrides of the method.  (1) may not always work because we're using a private API [new Lookup(clazz, int)], but we need to do that in order to non-public classes.  (2) may not always work because it's possible to have more than one compatible method signature.
    
    In the unlikely case that both (1) & (2) fail, we give an error message.
    Also: we must validate the default method's return type for visibility vs the factory type's visibility too.
    
    This ends up with two possible differences caused by java8:
    a) If the Lookup cxtor can't be used (different JDK, version skew, etc..) and there's more than one compatible method signature: we fail.
    b) If the default method's return type isn't public but the factory is public: we fail.
    
    For reference, javac8 generates a default method in the following scenario:
    interface Parent<I extends CharSequence, O extends Number> {
    O create(I input);
    }
    interface Child<String, Integer> {
    Integer create(String input);
    }
    
    Child has a generated default method of:
    Number create(CharSequence input);
    
    ... so, for example, failure could be newly triggered if 'Number' was package-private but Child was public, or if the reflection APIs didn't work and Child also had a 'Integer create(StringBuilder input);' method.

    Implement my old patch for issue #366, with some tweaks.  This does the
    following:
    * Fixes @Provides injection so that parameters are checked for nullability.
    By default this will error.  The flag is named:
    guice_check_nullable_provides_params and can be set to ERROR, WARNING or IGNORE.
    * Adds InjectionPoint.forMethod to build an InjectionPoint off an arbitrary
    method.
    * Adds Binder.getProvider(Dependency) to a get a Provider for a given
    dependency (with all its nullability & injection points maintained).
    * Update ProviderLookup to accept a Dependency in addition to a Key.
    
    This is in preparation for two things:
    1) Allowing multibindings/mapbindings/optionalbindings to be specified as
    annotations on methods in a module.
    2) Adding a dagger compatibility module.
    ... the general idea will be that I'll also add a hook into
    ProvidesMethodModule somehow to look at arbitrary other annotations and let
    folks process them specially.

    Fix linked binding behavior with requireExplicitBindings() in the parent.
    
    The old behavior was to try to create the binding in the parent,

    Robustness: wrap any calls to System.getProperty in case security is enabled.
    
    Since calling System.getProperty may throw an exception on locked-down systems.
    
    Note: this patch has the side-effect of making the 'guice_include_stack_traces'
    setting static, rather than querying the system property each time a module is
    installed. Making the setting static improves performance as System.getProperty
    can be a bottleneck, at the cost of being able to change the setting
    on-the-fly.

    Adds a binding for Collection<javax.inject.Provider<E>> to Multibinder.
    Before, only a Collection<com.google.inject.Provider<E>> was bound; now
    both are bound.
    
    Note that this required changes to SpiUtils because MapBinder uses a
    Multibinder to bind Set<Entry<K, Provider<V>>. There is a bit of
    strangeness here because it means that there is now a binding for
    Collection<javax.inject.Provider<Map.Entry<K, Provider<V>>>.

    Add "BOM" (Bill Of Material) for easier use with Maven

    Add "BOM" (Bill of Materials) for easier use with Maven
    
    Guice extensions must generally have their version match the one
    of Guice. Maven provides an easy way to make sure this is the case
    with “BOMs” [1].
    
    To make sure all your Guice dependencies (either direct or
    transitive) use the same version (unless overridden), just add the
    following to your <dependencyManagement> section:
    
        <dependency>
          <groupId>com.google.inject</groupId>
          <artifactId>guice-bom</artifactId>
          <version>${guice.version</version>
          <type>pom</type>
          <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>

    Making Singleton's creation lock less coarse.
    
    Singleton is defined as a scope which creates no more than one
    object per injector. It's highly confusing when you catch a deadlock
    between two unrelated injectors due to the same class injection.
    
    Problem is demonstrated using a test that recreates scenario when
    one thread injecting class can block other thread to use its own
    injector.
    
    Proposed solution is to use Injector-wide locks in a singleton.
    ThreadLocal as a way to store current state.

    Introduce a test that shows a JPA provider being passed a datasource
    from guice in a map, rather than from the persistence.xml file.
    
    Note that this requires a modern version of hibernate since older versions
    did not correctly process passed objects.

    Allow JPA properties to be Objects as well as simple strings.
    
    JpaPersistService takes a parameter thus:
       Properties persistenceProperties
    
    However, this is used later to create an entity manager:
      Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(persistenceUnitName,
                                             persistenceProperties);
    
    The signature for that method is (String, Map) NOT (String, Properties).
    
    If one is using Hibernate, you can pass the desired DataSource object in
    using that Map with Environment.DATASOURCE storing the actual object.
    Clearly you cannot do that if it's Properties (String->String map)
    
    Changing this so that the persistenceProperties is a Map would solves this,
    so you may now do (for example)
    
      DataSource ds = ...;
      Map p = new HashMap();
      p.put( Environment.DATASOURCE, ds );
      JpaPersistModule jpaPersistModule = new JpaPersistModule("myapp-db")
                                              .properties(p);
    
    Since all Properties objects *are* Map instances, this is a non-breaking
    change.

    Add a lazy option to @Bind.
    
    Often I want to @Bind SettableProvider<Foo> provider, but i can't because
    BoundFieldModule doesn't recognize it.  I can work around via a custom provider
    that just reads a class field, but i figured it would probably make more sense
    just to add this feature to @Bind directly.

    Fix the compareBuilds script (compares mvn vs ant generated jars) & add it to travis (before publishing snapshots).  Comment out comparing the noaop builds since they're different right now, and update to asm 5.0.3 (which was a source of a difference).

    Guice Multibindings: convert multibinding anonymous providers into package-private inner classes so that @Inject methods can be referenced by generated code.

commit c34e0185fcf508a890c6cd13bdafeb505c3e9e8a
Author: Sam Berlin <sameb@google.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 6 11:56:26 2014 -0400

    Implement binding deduplication for multibinder & mapbinder in a different way.
    Instead of relying on Guice binding deduplication (and hacking up RealElement
    to break the annotation contract to do so, causing weirdness in WeakKeySet &
    forcing us to care about "rehashing keys"), we instead deduplicate within
    Multibinder.  The downside of this is that toInstance or toProvider(instance)
    bindings that are deduplicated will remain in the object graph but effectively
    be unreachable.  However, that's a downside I'm willing to live with to remove
    this hack.

    Fix last flaky test (that I know of).  The problem was we were asserting that something existed in a child injector (through inference, by checking it was in the parent blacklist), but if GC ran it could have been ejected from the parent blacklist (since the child injector isn't strongly referenced anywhere).
    
    There's an actual problem here that we should fix (remove items from the parent blacklist immediately if the child injector fails to create itself), but before fixing that we can at least make the test not flake.

    Add support for OptionalBinder to link to normal bindings of that type if
    neither setDefault nor setBinding are called.  From the javadoc, example:
    
    * <pre><code>
    * public class FrameworkModule extends AbstractModule {
    *   protected void configure() {
    *     OptionalBinder.newOptionalBinder(binder(), Renamer.class);
    *   }
    * }</code></pre>
    *
    * <p>With this module, an {@link Optional}{@code <Renamer>} can now be
    * injected.  With no other bindings, the optional will be absent.
    * Users can specify bindings in one of two ways:
    *
    * <p>Option 1:
    * <pre><code>
    * public class UserRenamerModule extends AbstractModule {
    *   protected void configure() {
    *     bind(Renamer.class).to(ReplacingRenamer.class);
    *   }
    * }</code></pre>
    *
    * <p>or Option 2:
    * <pre><code>
    * public class UserRenamerModule extends AbstractModule {
    *   protected void configure() {
    *     OptionalBinder.newOptionalBinder(binder(), Renamer.class)
    *         .setBinding().to(ReplacingRenamer.class);
    *   }
    * }</code></pre>
    * With both options, the {@code Optional<Renamer>} will be present and supply the
    * ReplacingRenamer.

    Simplify OptionalBinder implementation to not delegate to a MapBinder.
    Instead, bind directly to annotated @Actual/@Default keys.  This is in
    preparation for future improvements.

    Detect overrides of @Provides method and add an error for each one.
    
    Overriding an @Provides method is fairly rare and can be very confusing (e.g. a covariant override).  This will not be backwards compatible for open source users.

    Try to use cglibs FastClass to invoke @Provides methods, it's faster!
    
    Here is a caliper benchmark to demonstrate the difference.
    https://caliper.googleplex.com/runs/2d349fec-2742-45e1-b6e5-16997c522387#r:scenario.benchmarkSpec.methodName,scenario.benchmarkSpec.parameters.strategy
    
    This should save about 200-300 ns per method invocation and about 224 bytes (over 4 objects) of allocations for each invocation.
    
    The cost of this (of course) is greater permgen usage and potentially slower startup/injector creation due to the class generation.

    Ignore synthetic/bridge methods when determining if a method should be injected.  This broke injections for different reasons before & after java8, but the fix is the same for both.
    
    Add a test with method injection points & super/sub classes that change method visibility, to confirm that synthesized/bridged methods don't artificially change what's injected or the parameters of the injections.

    Fix MapBinder's duplicate key error message so that more than one binding with the same source gets listed twice.  This was causing a problem with the tests that turned stack traces off, because the two different bindings line numbers were both changed to "Unknown Source", so it collapsed them into a single item.
    
    Maven ran all the flag variations for core + extensions.
    Internal builds ran them all just for core, not the extensions (fixed in this CL).
    Ant runs them all for core, but doesn't even run any extension tests AFAICT (not fixed in this CL).

Author: Christian Edward Gruber <cgruber@google.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 1 15:07:55 2014 -0700

    Adds a new OptionalBinder.  OptionalBinder allows frameworks to setup bindings for items that user code may or may not bind.  It also allows frameworks to set default values that users can override.
    
    The API is:
    OptionalBinder.newOptionalBinder(Binder, Class|TypeLiteral|Key) -> OptionalBinder
    optionalBinder.setDefault -> LinkedBindingBuilder
    optionalBinder.setBinding -> LinkedBindingBuilder
    
    By way of example, this will do:
    
    newOptionalBinder(..) -> @Inject Thing -> exception: neither setDefault nor setBinding called
    newOptionalBinder(..) -> @Inject Optional<Thing> -> isPresent() == false
    newOptionalBinder(..).setDefault().to("a") -> @Inject Thing -> "a"
    newOptionalBinder(..).setDefault().to("a") -> @Inject Optional<Thing> --> get() == "a"
    newOptionalBinder(..).setDefault().to("a") + newOptionalBinder(..).setBinding().to("b") -> @Inject Thing -> "b"
    newOptionalBinder(..).setDefault().to("a") + newOptionalBinder(..).setBinding().to("b") -> @Inject Optional<Thing> -> get() == "b"
    newOptionalBinder(..).setBinding().to("b") -> @Inject Thing -> "b"
    newOptionalBinder(..).setBinding().to("b") -> @Inject Optional<Thing> -> get() == "b"
    newOptionalBinder(..).setDefault().to("a") + newOptionalBinder(..).setDefault().to("b") -> configuration exception
    newOptionalBinder(..).setBinding().to("a") + newOptionalBinder(..).setBinding().to("b") -> configuration exception
    
    (This also adds the jsr305 jar for build time, because doclava wanted it. Frustrating.)
    
    (This also fixes users that implemented MultibindingsTargetVisitor, because I can't use default methods yet.)

    Add an SPI for @Provides methods (using the extensions SPI) so that users can
    do more analysis (with the enclosing instance, method, etc..).
    
    Notably, this can let users write analysis that looks for @Provides methods
    declared with @Nullable, and compare against injection points w/o @Nullable,
    failing if so.

    Change LinkedBindingBuilder.toProvider(Provider) to accept a jsr330 provider,
    in addition to the Guice Provider.  This is an incompatible change for people who extend LinkedBindingBuilder, but not for people who use it.
    
    This will allow people to switch to JSR330 types more easily.
    
    LinkedBindingBuilder needs both toProvider(Provider) and toProvider(javax.inject.Provider) because precompiled jars (e.g, stuff in third_party, maven, etc..) that used toProvider(Provider) would otherwise throw a NoSuchMethodError.
    
    I left the getProviderInstance method on ProviderInstanceBinding, otherwise
    that would require anyone using the SPI method to change their code to accept
    the weaker type.

    A Message should have only one source but as it is used in Errors, currently it can have multiple sources. The Message objects is returned from two public methods(Elements#getElements() and Errors#getMessages()) that make any changes in its method declarations difficult. As the first step, I am going to remove all calls to the Message constructor that receives multiple sources from []. So, the only calls will be from Errors that I will deal with separately.

    Fix issue 723 -- minor optimizations to TypeConverterBindingProcessor.
    Description in the bug describes this best:
    TypeConverterBindingProcessor has two responsibilities: 1) prepare built-in type
    converters for primitives, enums, classes, etc. and 2) process TypeConverter
    bindings and register them with the containing injector.
    
    The first responsibility only needs the injector reference, it doesn't need
    access to the processor's Errors cache. However, the current implementation
    runs in the context of the processor and creates a number of anonymous classes,
    and they all contain an implicit reference (this$0) back to the processor. This
    can lead to some Errors instances being kept alive longer than necessary by
    these anonymous classes, but not a large number.
    
    Changing the prepareBuiltInConverters implementation over to use static methods
    that pass the injector as an argument fixes this problem by removing the
    implicit reference to the processor, since the anonymous classes are now
    created from a static context.

    Make guice build with javac 8.
    
    javac 8 is more restrictive about generic type inference in situations
    involving raw types, which prevents guice from compiling. This change
    allows guice to be compiled with javac 8.

    Update Guice's maven build system to run the unit tests in three configurations, representing the three different values for stack-trace inclusion in error messages.  Additionally, modify the open-source InternalFlags to log a warning if a value is passed to the flag that does not correspond to the Enum.
    
    Tested:
    normal open-source tests in google's internal build
    full maven build from MOE's assembly of the open-source project

Author: Christian Edward Gruber <cgruber@google.com>

    Allow turning off stack trace collection in Guice.
    
    By setting guice_include_stack_traces flag OFF, Guice does not collect stack traces for identifying the declaring source of a binding. Instead it uses the first non-skipped module class name from the modules stack. As a result, in some cases, error messages can be slightly different with this flag. For example, the file name and line number are not always available.
    
    A sample error message with this flag :
    
    Guice creation errors:
    1) Received null converting foo (bound at com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest.configure(Unknown Source) (via modules: com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest -> com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest)) to java.util.Date
    using CustomConverter which matches only(java.util.Date) (bound at com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest.configure(Unknown Source) (via modules: com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest -> com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest -> com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest)).
    while locating java.util.Date annotated with @com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest()
    for field at com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest.date(TypeConversionTest.java:478)
    at com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest.configure(Unknown Source) (via modules: com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest -> com.google.inject.TypeConversionTest)
    
    This also changes the DEFAULT flag name to ONLY_FOR_DECLARTION_SOURCE.
    Adds InternalFlags.getIncludeStackTraceOption() to wrap system property access.

    Print out the modules that led to a binding during error reporting, but
    only if there's >1 module (otherwise it's just noise).  The format is
    Some normal messaging about the fact that something terrible happened
    at <the normal source> (via modules: A -> B -> C)
    
    So, for example, exposing something that isn't bound would show up as:
    1) Could not expose() Foo, it must be explicitly bound.
    at FooExposerModule.configure(FooExposerModule.java:211) (via modules: ParentModule -> FooExposerModule)
    
    .. and a duplicate binding would show up as:
    A binding to DuplicatedThing was already configured at ModuleA.configure(ModuleA.java:36) (via modules: ParentModule -> FooModule -> ModuleA)
    at ModuleA.configure(ModuleA.java:36) (via modules: ParentModule -> BarModule -> ModuleA)
    
    All the tests passed as-is (because this is just new information), so I made a bunch of tests stricter to explicitly look for this new information.
    
    I also cleaned up some other errors regarding scopes & some other stuff.

    An alternative way to support ShareableModule, Modules.override and Multibinder: use annotations that compare equal iff the binding strategy matches, so Guice will dedupe for us.
    
    This CL includes a noteworthy adaptation of an earlier attempt which caused timeouts in some client tests, forcing a rollback ([]). Because Key caches its hashCode, we were inadvertently inserting every binding for a given multibound set into the same hashmap bucket, causing at best O(n^2) behaviour (and possibly worse, depending on how HashMap is implemented). To fix this, this CL adds changes to core Guice to recompute the Key's hashCode at injector construction time. (In fact, at the end of every Elements.getElements call, so any SPI-based code gets the same benefits.)

    Updates the internals of an Element's source to keep track of the Modules that installed it, as well as the complete stack trace leading to the binding. The data is not yet exposed in Element.getSource(), but will be exposed in a future CL.
    
    Technical details:
    1) The call stack data is only available for elements created by the binder (excepting Message objects). So, elements that are created at injection time (e.g, JIT bindings, Stage, Injector, Logger, etc.) will not contain these data.
    For elements affected, ElementSource.getDeclaringSource() should return what is returned by getSource() currently.
    2) In the case of binding builder, similar to the current implementation, ElementSource provides the call stack of builder creation not 'element addition to the binder's elements.'

    Change Key so that it upgrades Annotation classes where all methods have default values into an instance of the Annotation with the defaults as values, so that:
      @Retention(RUNTIME)
      @BindingAnnotation @interface AllDefaults {

      }
    
      @AllDefaults class Foo {}

    Fix http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/issues/detail?id=742 by having assistedinject fail if the target implementation class has a scop
    ing annotation on it.  Scope annotations on assistedinject targets were always ignored by Guice, and allowing them on the classes led to lots of confusion when reading code.  The new behavior makes for much more readable code.
    
    This could potentially cause runtime errors at injector creation time if you accidentally had scoping annotations on the implementation class.  The fix is just to remove that scoping annotation -- there will be no change in behavior, because the scope was ignored.
    
    There is an extreme edge case where this change may cause a problem, but it creates sufficiently confusing code that we are OK with turning it into a failure: You used assistedinject yet had no assisted parameters, and sometimes injected the object directly and other times constructed it through the factory.  When injecting directly, it would adhere to the scope, but when constructing through the factory it would create a new instance every time.  ... If you *really* wanted this behavior, the workaround would be to bind using toConstructor in Scopes.NO_SCOPE to a named(unscoped) version of the class, which is also more expressive.  (But, more often than not, what you really wanted was to *not do this*.)

    Add a new method to ThrowingProviderBinder: providing(Class) or providing(TypeLiteral).
    This instructs ThrowingProviderBinder to create a proxy implementation of the CheckedProvider interface and delegate it to the constructor of the class in question.  As a bonus, the class it constructs fully participates in Guice AOP.
    
    This is a binary-safe change, but a compile-unsafe change if classes directly kept a reference to SecondaryBinder.  SecondaryBinder now has two generic types (as opposed to one).

    Add Scopes.isCircularProxy, for use by Scope implementations.  The basic problem is that somewhere along the line, Guice is breaking the type-safety of <T> in the scope(Key<T>, Provider<T>) method.  This happens when <T> is involved in a circular dependency, and the ConstructionContext creates a circular proxy for a given 'expectedType' of <T> (the type in the parameter where it's being injected).  Expected type is a superclass or superinterface of <T>, not a subclass or subinterface, so if a Scope caches the result of Key<T> -> Provider<T>.get(), and then tries to reuse it, it's possible that we return something that isn't compatible with <T>.  This results in either a ClassCastException (if cglib is involved) or IllegalArgumentException (java reflection) when trying to construct the object, because the parameters don't match the arguments.

    Fix a bug in the way failed JIT bindings are cleaned up.  Because we removed bindings from the jitBindings Map, it was possible for an Injector to try and recreate the failed JIT binding.  Normally we want this behavior.. but in the case of a circular failed JIT binding, it can lead to a ComputationException from ComputingConcurrentHashMap, because we attempt to create two ConstructorInjectors for the same InjectionPoint recursively.

    Refactoring of guice-grapher
    - makes it possible to inject non-scoped graphers
    - fixes http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/issues/detail?id=489 (in
    the sense that the exposed node is graphed, it still doesn't follow
    private bindings)
    - simplifies implementation classes:
    - aliasing, node creating and edge creating are done as three
    independent steps
    - implementation classes will get aliased nodes so they don't need to
    worry about aliasing
    - edges are always created after the nodes they link
    - removes boilerplate code to build node and edge factories

    switch Guice from manually repackaging Guava to depending on Guava.  it's still jarjar'd right now, which is causing a ~400k increase in guice-snapshot.jar.  next step is to switch to ProGuard to remove the unnecessary code and cut it back down (even further?!).  this will let people build from Guice source and depend directly on Guava code without having to worry about hiding internal/util.

    issue 345 - better error message for private modules.  show the source of a child binding instead of just saying its in a child injector.  also give a hint that you may have wanted to expose the binding.

    rework method interception so that methods that aren't intercepted don't go through cglib, reducing the number of stack frames in most method calls.  this has a slight side effect that additional proxy classes are generated for a single class if (and only if) the intercepted methods change.  if the intercepted methods remain the same, then the proxy classes will continue to be shared (so things like assistedinject will not blow up the heap).

    Remove AOP boilerplate from user visible stack traces.
    
    We received complaints because AOP stack traces are difficult to follow. This removes almost everything. The weird thing about this change is that the stack traces contain gaps. Anyone tracing through a stack trace should recognize that proceed() or invoke() means that AOP is in play.
    
    The stack trace of a method that was subject to two interceptors used to look like this:
    
    java.lang.Exception: kaboom!
    	at com.publicobject.Interceptable.explode(Interceptable.java:203)
    	at com.publicobject.Interceptable$$EnhancerByGuice$$5ffccef9.CGLIB$explode$2(<generated>)
    	at com.publicobject.Interceptable$$EnhancerByGuice$$5ffccef9$$FastClassByGuice$$20c8faff.invoke(<generated>)
    	at net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy.invokeSuper(MethodProxy.java:228)
    	at com.google.inject.internal.InterceptorStackCallback$InterceptedMethodInvocation.proceed(InterceptorStackCallback.java:72)
    	at com.publicobject.InterceptorB.invoke(InterceptorB.java:57)
    	at com.google.inject.internal.InterceptorStackCallback$InterceptedMethodInvocation.proceed(InterceptorStackCallback.java:72)
    	at com.publicobject.InterceptorA.invoke(InterceptorA.java:50)
    	at com.google.inject.internal.InterceptorStackCallback$InterceptedMethodInvocation.proceed(InterceptorStackCallback.java:72)

    	at com.publicobject.MyTest.testInterceptedMethodThrows(MyTest.java:181)
    
    Now it looks like this:
    
    java.lang.Exception: kaboom!
    	at com.publicobject.Interceptable.explode(Interceptable.java:203)
    	at com.publicobject.InterceptorB.invoke(InterceptorB.java:57)

    update ThrowingProvider to support an @ThrowingProvides annotation, much like @Provides.  update the internals of the class to give more explicit error messaging & use bind.addError instead of throwing exceptions.  added lots & lots of tests.

    Support for custom request scopes overloaded onto the @RequestScoped annotation.
    
    Also added ability to seed a scope map for both continuing HTTP request scopes as well as custom request scopes.
    
    Also changed continuing HTTP requests in other request threads to fail if they happen to run in an HTTP request thread as per sberlin's recommendation. See tests for details

    Remove support for com.google.inject annotations from miniguice. Relying on JSR-330 classes only is simpler, and aligned with the goals for the project.
    
    Also fixing bugs where supertype fields weren't injected.
    
    Also improving error reporting when an injection fails to include the requiring injection. Otherwise things like "Expected injection of String" fails miserably.

    MiniGuice, a proof of concept.
    
    The standard Guice injector hits a diverse set of use cases with a small core. It has advanced features to make developers productive and it's very fast. And it scales to extremely large teams very well. In a world of JavaEE aircraft carriers, Guice is a sports car.
    
    To contrast, MiniGuice (placeholder name) is roller skates. It has barely any features and can't do anything but the bare essentials: field & constructor injection, provider methods, provider injections, singletons, and binding annotations. It's intended for use in tiny dozen-file projects maintained by a single developer in leisure time. It's only features are its compact size and implementation simplicity.

    Complete reworking of the guice-persist module and API. It is MUCH leaner now and easily facilitates multiple modules. All legacy tests are still passing.
    
    The next step is writing some multiple modules assertions and sanity checks for DynamicFinders. In particular, the API for creating a PersistModule requires some attention from reviewers too.
    
    Finally, pending adding db4o support back in, guice-persist will be ready for release =)

    part of issue 526 -- move MoreTypes.memberKey into LineNumbers.  LineNumbers was its only use, and the way LineNumbers used it, it was heavily dependent on the implementation staying the same (one area constructed its own key to insert into a hash map, and another area used the method to reconstruct & retrieve from the map).

    Make ProvisionException stack traces from @Provides methods clearer -- don't include all the intermediary RuntimeExceptions & InvocationTargetExceptions.  Just include the user's exception (even for checked exceptions).  Before this, a stack trace from a ProvisionException looked like:
    
    -----
    1) Error in custom provider, java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
      at com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionsTest$5.exploder(ProvisionExceptionsTest.java:134)

    remove confusing behavior from assistedinject -- it used to allow factory creations to be resolved by the injector if the return key matched something in the injector.  now it always creates new objects.  the prior behavior created a scenario where, if the following pseudo-code was used...
    
        public class Bar { ... }
        interface BarFactory {  Bar createBar(...); }
        ...
        protected void configure() {
              // allow custom Bars to be created if using BarFactory
              install(new FactoryModuleBuilder().build(BarFactory.class));
        }
        @Provides Bar defaultBar() {  // allow a default value
             return new Bar(...);
        }
    
    ...Someone wants to allow default Bars to be injected AND create custom ones if using BarFactory.  But, AssistedInject didn't actually do that.  When someone called BarFactory.create(...), it returned the bar created from the @Provides method, because AssistedInject saw the main injector had a binding for Bar.
    
    This removes that behavior, so AssistedInject will always create a new Bar when its factory method is called.

    Change behavior of method overriding if any methods in the call stack had @com.google.inject.Inject.  The new behavior is..
     * If subclass' method in question does not have any @Inject annotation, then:
        - If any overridden methods contained @com.google.inect.Inject, the method is still injected.
        - If the overriden methods only contained @javax.inject.Inject, the method is *not* injected, per the JSR spec.
    
     This change reverts back to a Guice 1.0 & 2.0 behavior (preserving the existing fix so the injection point isn't called twice).
    
     This is a functional difference between com.google.inject.Inject and javax.inject.Inject, but one we're willing to live with.

    Fixed GuiceFilter so that it no longer depends on a static pipeline. If GuiceFilter is created by the injector, it will prefer an injected pipeline over the static one, preventing horridness in tests and other production environments with multiple GuiceFilters.
    
    Also degraded the severity of multiple GuiceFilters being present to a warning only, to accomodate the aforementioned use cases in all environments.

    patch AssistedInject extension to support multi-constructor injection with FactoryModuleBuilder.  reuses @AssistedInject annotation to mark valid constructors.  undeprecates @AssistedInject.  deprecates FactoryProvider in favor of FactoryModuleBuilder now that all functionality is matched and performance problems are fixed.  you can still get the "old" behavior (ordered matching of parameters, non-guiced objects, etc..) by using @AssistedInject+FactoryProvider, but using @Inject or @AssistedInject with FactoryModuleBuilder will give you the new behavior.

    cleanup related to issue 395.  rather than using Guice.createInjectorBuilder, use "new InjectorBuilder()".  deprecated methods in Guice that took the Stage parameter.  (didn't deprecate other methods because it's still a good easy-to-use way to start getting into Guice.)  added more tests to JitBindingsTest for @Provides, child injectors & private modules (private modules was broken!). rolled passing around Injector options (stage, jitDisabled) into a new InjectorOptions class to prevent those things from breaking again in the future.  renamed InjectorBuilderImpl to InternalInjectorCreator because it has to be public for InjectorBuilder to use it, and didn't want to confuse auto-complete IDEs into offering InjectorBuilderImpl as an option.

    fixes issue 342 - ability to disable JIT bindings (require explicit bindings).  this revision creates a new public facing API of:
     * Guice.createInjectorBuilder()
     * Injector.createChildInjectorBuilder()
     * com.google.inject.InjectorBuilder
          .stage(Stage)
          .requireExplicitBindings()
          .addModules(Iterable<? extends Module>)
          .addModules(Module... modules)
          .build()
    
    There are three kinds of bindings Guice can handle: explicit, implicit, and JIT.  Explicit bindings are where there's a bind() call for that type.  Implicit bindings are where there's a bind(A).to(B) call (B is the implicit binding).  JIT bindings are where there's no binding, but the code requests an injection.
    
     The internals are changed so that if requireExplicitBindings() is called in the InjectorBuilder, then Guice will fail to create an Injector for any injection that is not an explicit binding.  Implicit bindings are allowed to be used in a Module, but unless the implicit binding was also explicitly bound then no class can directly inject the implicit binding.  Injector.get[Instance|Provider] will also fail for JIT or implicit bindings.  Injector.getBinding will succeed if for explicit & implicit bindings (but it won't create new JIT bindings), but Binding.getProvider will fail for implicit bindings.
    
    In a nutshell, if you requireExplicitBindings() is called, then the Module must explicitly bind everything that's injected.  (@ProvidedBy & @ImplementedBy on types are still supported as shortcuts for implicit bindings.)

    Use a marker interface rather than the Proxy APIs to discover if returned singletons are circular-dependency proxies

    Explode when circularly dependent singletons cannot be fixed by our constructor proxies. As it stands, sometimes a singleton can result in two instances being created.

    Possibly the riskiest change in order to improve JSR 330 integration: Now it's possible to directly bind a javax.inject.Provider type literal using our DSL.
    
    Generally this change would not be binary-compatible with our released API, but type erasure makes it Just Work.

    First effort at support for JSR 330.
    
    This checkin supports:
       @javax.inject.Inject to mark classes
       @javax.inject.Qualifier to identify binding annotations
       javax.inject.Provider injections
       A new Jsr330 utility class
    
    Still outstanding:
       JSR 330 is more strict about where its annotations are applied. These restrictions are not yet enforced.
       @Scope
       @Singleton
    
    Notable change:
       When the user injects a javax.inject.Provider<T>, we canonicalize the dependency, and treat it exactly as if they injected a com.google.inject.Provider<T>. This is slightly weird! For example, these two keys are equal:
    Key.get(new TypeLiteral<javax.inject.Provider<String>>() {})
    Key.get(new TypeLiteral<com.google.inject.Provider<String>>() {})
       This is convenient, particularly for SPI users. And it means we don't need a linked binding between the Providers. But it could be quite surprising. I'm still trying to decide the right long term solution here...

    Jesse's tweaks to aragos' patch r1063. His patch was quite well implemented and these changes are mostly pedantic.
    
    Most notably, I un-deprecated FactoryProvider, replacing the deprecation tag with an obsolete warning. We should make a best effort to fix deprecated callers before we deprecate something, otherwise we're punishing our users for our own mistakes.

    Some small optimizations. Getting sources still takes the most time of all (~40%), followed by reflective access on the methods and fields of classes. There's not much we can do here, aside from the often-suggested compile-time code-gen DI.

    New API: Multibinder.permitDuplicates() and MapBinder.permitDuplicates()
    
    When a map binder is configured to permit duplicate keys, the value chosen is arbitrary! This may be frustrating; but otherwise it would be necessary to actually call Provider.get() on the duplicated values to compare 'em; I think the cure would be worse than the disease

    Post release refactor. I moved almost everything that was package-private in com.google.inject to the internal package. The motivation is to simplify things - the previous setup was extremely awkward because c.g.i could call into internal, but not the reverse. Similarly for the SPI package.
    
    This refactoring reduces the visibility of many symbols in internal, and makes some other code hygeine changes.
    
    Once this is checked in, it should be much easier to add the toConstructor() binding type. That was previously difficult because the ConstructorBindingImpl class was package private and intertwined with that package.

    Band-aid for issue 373. I'm not particularly thrilled about needing to explicitly check for linked bindings, but it's the least invasive code I could come up with.
    
    The real underlying problem is that we don't eagerly create instances at any time other than injector creation.

    Changes from Isaac Shum that change the bindings for ServletRequest and ServletResponse to be chained to their HTTP counterparts rather than to be both bound directly to the same provider.
    
    Also changing those bindings to be scoped appropriately.
    
    And finally, changing much of servlet module to leverage provider methods. This cleanup is cosmetic.

    Fix for an embarassing bug reported by Dmitry Skavish.
    http://groups.google.com/group/google-guice/browse_thread/thread/8f0a092727a0227c
    
    We have a bunch of code for aggressively detecting many errors before failing. Unfortunately, there was a situation where we'd detect an error and keep going (to find more errors), but forget to ultimately throw the error.
    
    This resulted in polluting the JIT bindings cache, which breaks the world. The fix is easiest to reproduce with Child Injectors, but I believe it's also possible to poison the JIT bindings cache without child injectors.
    
    Note:
    The specific error we omit is the "Scope not found" error. In Guice 1.0, no error was reported if a scope wasn't found. So although this is an unfortunate problem, its not much worse than what we did previously. I don't think it's necessary to cut a "Guice 2.0.1" for this problem. The main difference is that the error impacts whether a binding will live in parent or child injector.

    patch from mcculls:
    Rolling back one of the optimizations to avoid leaving garbage behind in a ThreadLocal. The extra reference can cause the thread to strongly hold the injector, which is bad for application unloading.
    
    Regrettably, this costs about 12% throughput. Even so, we're still creating almost a million objects per second on my laptop, so we're still good.

    Some low-hanging fruit optimizations.
    
    These make the code worse, but they make performance significantly better so they're justified.
    
    These changes result in 55% more throughput on the PerformanceComparison benchmark. We're back to beating Guice 1.0 on that benchmark (by 8% in one measurement).

     - renamed InjectableTypeListenerBinding to TypeListenerBinding

    A couple of test changes:
     - to ensure that lookups are valid by the time InjectionListener.hear() is called
     - to ensure that classes with no @Inject-annotated members still fire the injectable type listener. This test is currently failing.

    Support deferred lookups of providers and members injectors from the Encounter.
    
    The behaviour is slightly different depending on when the InjectableTypeListener.hear() method is invoked...
    
    A) If it's invoked before the Injector is created, then getProvider() always returns immediately. The provider may not be used until the injector has been created.
    
    B) If it's invoked after the Injector has been created, then getProvider() builds the provider immediately. This includes the work to build the binding (recursively) and this method may fail with a ConfigurationException.
    
    It would be possible to change B) to behave more like A), but the utility of doing so is quite limited. One case that still needs test coverage is when the listener calls getProvider(B.class) while hearing about B. For now, this will probably fail. That's probably okay for now.

    Regrettably replacing jarjar'd Google Collections with minimal copies of the parts that we use.
    
    The main benefit is a (significant) reduction in size of the Guice+AOP .jar - from 1004KB to 641KB. The drawback is that it's now a lot harder to use new Google Collections features, or to keep up-to-date with Google Collections bugfixes and optimizations.

    Removing all ASM and cglib dependencies from the no_aop build of Guice.
    
    We now remove those .jar files from the build package, and remove references to them from our build in common.xml.
    
    Some tests now fail because they're written to expect a specific class name in the exception message, like:
       "at com.google.inject.Foo.<init>(Foo.java:223)"
    but without LineNumbers we show a message like:
       "at com.google.inject.Foo.<init>(Unknown Source)"
    These failures are annoying but not really a dealbreaker for me. I'd prefer to have failing tests in the no-aop build than to not have test coverage for line number inclusion.

    Removing all references to method interceptors from the non-AOPified Guice. This passes the full Guice test suite (other than the interceptor tests that are removed, and the tests that fail in the normal Guice build).
    
    I still need to remove FastClass/FastMethod references. That should be substantially easier. (Although this was fairly straightforward)
    
    I'm not sure about the variable names AOP and NO_AOP. Suggestions welcome.

    Initial support for building an AOP-free copy of the Guice source tree from the standard source tree.
    
    The new build.xml creates a complete copy of the entire source tree in build/no_aop, stripping the lines between these tags:
      /*if[AOP]*/
      /*end[AOP]*/
    Currently I'm only removing Binder#removeInterceptor(), but in a follow-up CL I'll fix it so that all bytecode-generation code is stripped out. I'll probably refactor the standard code so this can be done with minimal impact.
    
    With this strategy we produce a full Guice source tree, which we can then use to run testcases on, do builds, etc. The entire approach is similar to the one we used with Glazed Lists to erase generics.
    
    The stripping builds on Tom Ball's Munge.java program, with a few alterations:
     - we're a bit more careful about handling /* in end-of-line comments and Strings
     - I wrote an Ant task called MungeTask that supports munging an entire fileset

    Improves Grapher's display of names:
     - Instances are now rendered with their #toString() if they're not the
       default Object implementation.
     - String instances are displayed as string literals.
     - ProviderMethods are rendered as a method signature.
     - Instance sources are now just rendered as the file name and line number.

    Adds grapher extension, an implementation for a Graphviz-based tool to

    output.
    
    See com.google.inject.grapher.demo.InjectorGrapherDemo for an example and to
    generate a sample graph.

    Removing the obsolete commands extension. Almost all of it has been rolled into the Guice SPI.
    
    The only remining file (InterceptingInjectorBuilder) now exists for maintenance on a new project that I set up for my personal use:
    http://code.google.com/p/publicobject/
    I'll have to copy this into Guiceberry which is currently the only project I know of that depends on this file.
    
    My biggest problem with IIB is that it's a leaky abstraction. Unfortunately many bindings cannot be intercepted - anything that binds directly to a constructor is not eligible for interception. The approach taken by the guiceyfruit project (and potentially useful for inclusion in Guice proper) might be preferred. http://code.google.com/p/guiceyfruit/

    Supporting HasDependencies for Multibinder, MapBinder and AssistedInject v1.
    
    AssistedInject v2 support isn't here yet, it's difficult. Since we use a child injector in that package, we need a strategy for how the bindings from that injector should work. I don't think getting this perfect is urgent.

    - Restored Bob's binding interfaces - LinkedBinding, InstanceBinding, etc.
    - Moved Binding implementation classes to internal/ so the implementations could  be shared by both Injector bindings and Module bindings
    - Added HasDependencies interface, implemented it for ProviderMethods
    - Cleaned up our internal model of scopes to use the 'Scoping' class, which is like scope annotation/instance + eager/lazy.

    Big API change to AssistedInject Deluxe.
    
    I unified the API - both old and new use the same API, and the code detects which to use (by looking for the presence or absence of an @AssistedInject annotation)
    
    This means that:
     - Upgrading from new to old is extremely easy
     - Unified Javadocs for old and new. The new Javadocs just have a section pointing out the differences when @AssistedInject is used instead of @Assisted
     - It's a little clumsier to make sure you're getting the right one. This is mitigated by some new checks on the factory interface to ensure the old constructor isn't used with the newer factories.
    
    Also applying local variable naming fixes to InjectionPoint, as pointed out by Brian Harris.

    Changed ProxyFactory so that AOP generated proxy classes can be shared between injectors.  We leverage cglib's cache, which required us to defer setting the callbacks until the instance is about to be created. It also requires us to support equals() and hashCode() for all objects used to configure the Enhancer.
    
    In Guice v1, Injectors were almost always long-lived so the extra permgen space wasn't an issue. But now that we support child injectors, since it's a lot more likely that injectors will be created, used, and discarded.
    
    Also some misc. changes:
     - adding my @author tag to TypeLiteral. I wrote the new type resolution stuff here.
     - changing SingleParameterInjector to use Object[0] rather than null to represent an empty set of params.

    AssistedInject Deluxe.
    
    This introduces a new static utility class, Factories, that can be used to build factories. It behaves very similarly to FactoryProvider, with a few minor differences:
     - matching is by @Assisted("name") rather than position
     - AOP is supported
     - factory params can be injected anywhere - as parameters, Providers, method arguments, indirect dependencies, etc.
     - cglib is used internally instead of Proxy. This allows the factory to be injected directly

    Applied mcculls patch for issue 235 - OSGi classloading. The goal is to use a bridge classloader whenever:
     - the OSGi-invoked/extended methods are public
     - the application classes are not loaded in a System classloader
    
    This changes mccull's original patch by using the System Class Loader if that was used to load the application classes. This should be a fairly reasonable thing to do, and it means users who aren't using OSGi or Java EE get a simpler experience.

    Fix for bug 242.
    
    We warn if the user misplaces a binding annotation. In Scala, binding annotations are applied to accessor methods automatically, and there's nothing the user can do (to suppress the warning). So we special case it and don't warn. There might be a tiny number of false negatives; this shouldn't really be a problem.

    Fix for issue 254.
    http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/issues/detail?id=254
    
    This solution is unfortunate but it works... For each extension like assistedinject, we use jarjar to create a .jar with all dependencies embedded. This classes in this jar have "imports" that point at the .internal versions of our libraries.
    
    Then we create a second jar that's a copy of the first without the internal/ package. This way Guice only includes one copy of collections, etc.
    
    It would be convenient if jarjar had a feature where it could remap imports without actually embedding 'em.

    Pretty massive rewrite of PrivateModules so that they're now implemented in core Guice.
    
    This change introduces InjectorShell, an unfortunate class to hold an in-progress injector while it's being constructed. It refactors InjectorBuilder to support building several injectors simultaneously.
    
    Still outstanding is fixing up the docs for PrivateModule and these new APIs.

    Adding newPrivateBinder() to the SPI. We're promoting private bindings from an extension to being a part of core Guice!
    
    This code isn't wired up yet, so creating injectors whose modules use this API will fail. In a follow-up CL, I'll add the implementation code and refactor the existing PrivateModule class to build on this.

    Key.get() now explodes when you give it a type parameter like 'T'. Guice has never supported this, but now we fail earlier.
    
    To contrast, TypeLiteral now has better support for type parameters like 'T'. This is necessary for better type resolution.

    Made type resolution way fast. We no longer build any collections -- instead we just do everything on demand. A very naive benchmark showed this to be much faster (50s vs 3s).
    
    Also merged TypeResolver with TypeLiteral. This exposes a bunch of new APIs for types - such as getting the generic parameter types of a method. I'm not convinced that we should be exposing all of this, but it's nice for extensions. For example, @Provides methods need type resolution.

    This change is big, and it makes Guice slower. I'll need to follow-up with some optimizations that make TypeResolver quicker.
    
    Suppose you have a parameterized class:
    
    class Foo<T> {
      @Inject Set<T> tees;
    }
    
    This change makes it so that as long as you have the required dependencies, parameterized injection points will be resolved. For example:
      Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new AbstractModule() {
        protected void configure() {
          bind(new TypeLiteral<Set<String>>() {})
              .toInstance(ImmutableSet.of("A", "B", "C"));
          }
      });
      Foo<String> foo = injector.getInstance(new TypeLiteral<Foo<String>>() {});
      assertEquals(ImmutableSet.of("A", "B", "C"), foo.tees);
    
    This builds on my earlier work for TypeResolver. That class is currently pretty slow (it builds a ton of HashMaps eagerly), but it shouldn't be too hard to make it lazy - that way everything will work nice and fast if you're not leveraging this feature.

    Hopefully the last of the big exceptions refactorings. I went through all of the places we're adding context to our Errors object and made sure we're never doubling-up -- specifing the same injection point or key multiple times.
    
    The new errors have nice 'at' lines for parameters, fields and linked bindings. Hopefully this makes it easier to follow the stacktraces. Additional context (such as the binding's origin in a module) could be added later if desired. Currently we have module-specific sources in CreationExceptions, and plain old binding sources elsewhere. The end result is messages that can look like this:
    
    com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Guice provision errors:
    
    1) Error injecting constructor, java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException

    Cleaning up exceptions and Javadoc:
    
    ConfigurationException, ProvisionException and CreationException are now all almost identical in implementation. We're careful to throw the appropriate one at the throwing site.
    
    Extensions may now cleanly contribute error messages to the Guice errors summary by throwing a ConfigurationException during injection. For example, if the Multibindings extension needs to throw an exception during initialization (ie. while an @Inject method is running), that exception will show up as if it had been published by Guice itself. I'm quite happy with this.
    
    Still to do  -- avoiding duplicate 'at' lines in the exception cause trce...

    Crazy circular-dependency tests for private modules, plus a fix to make them work.
    
    The most interesting works around a problem where the providers for singletons can be called multiple times. This happens when the provider uses its own singleton in processing.

    Refinements to PrivateModules:
     - new test cases
     - support for @Provides methods
     - error detection on keys that are exposed but not bound
    
    Also refactoring ProviderMethods to make this work.
    
    I'm beginning to run into a wall with what is possible with implementing private modules as an extension rather than as a part of core. In particular:
     - I need to hack ProviderMethods so they're not installed in the public scope
     - I need to hack BindingProcessor to tolerate doubly-bound keys for Private Modules
    
    The lack of core-support is also going to prevent private modules from having first-class support in the SPI. Ideally we should be able to have a binding type called "ChildBinding" to which the exposed keys belong. This binding would simply point at the child injector that implements the binding (and possibly the delegate binding also).
    
    It's also preventing me from being able to detect a small class of errors - when a child module binds a key that's exposed by one of its sibling modules, we don't detect the binding conflict.

    Rewrite of parent injectors.
    
    This implementation works okay, but there's still a lot of work to be done:
     - cross-injector concurrency is still weak. I've left TODOs in a few places where this needs to be addressed.
     - Initializer can be simplified further
     - we might be able to axe State/InheritingState. These were mostly for my sanity to constrain  where InjectorImpl gets its data
     - we can always have more test cases

    Last of the planned major changes to the SPI. Aside from Javadoc I consider the SPI to be complete for v2. (with a possible addition of a ProviderMethodBinding feature also)
    
    
    This change changes the interface of 3 methods of BindingTargetVisitor to take a Set<InjectionPoint>, which replaces the HasInjections interface.
    
    Also, making the ProviderMethods class non-public.
    
    Also, adding extra checks for serialization. I've still got to fix serialization of TypeLiteral.

    Moving error sources so they're now reported in the same place for configuration errors and runtime errors. This means that instead of seeing this:
      1) Error at com.google.Foo.class(Foo.java:123)
          No constructor for Foo was found
    
    We see this:
       1) No constructor for Foo was found
          at com.google.Foo.class(Foo.java:123)
    
    And what's really nice is we can now have a long chain of sources for errors. For example, suppose we follow bindings and discover something that won't work via a transitive dependency. That'll look like this:
       1) No constructor for Foo was found
          at com.google.Foo.class(Foo.java:123)
          for parameter 0 at com.google.Bar.inject(Bar.java:345)
          for field at com.google.Baz.baz(Baz.java:567)
    
    I'll still need to go over the errors code with a few more passes to tighten things up. But I believe this is a small leap forward in the usability in our already-fantastic errors.

    A new mechanical test suite with 114 tests, trying out various combinations of:
     - scopes (annotated and using .in())
     - bind targets (to key, to instance etc)
     - results (success or throwing)
    
    This test demonstrates that currently we're not properly wrapping RuntimeExceptions that are thrown by user code that's reached via @ProvidedBy and @ImplementedBy. I'll fix that bug in a future commit...

    We now support wildcards in bindings! The wildcards can only be used as type parameters for other types, not for  top-level bindings on their own.
    
    For example, we can bind these:
      List<Class<?>>
      List<? extends Runnable>
      List<? super Runnable>
      List<?>
      Map<String, ?>
    But not these:
      ?
      ? extends String
    
    Basically, everything that's bound needs a raw type. This makes sense! Since everything that's injected (fields and parameters) has a raw type (due to erasure)
    
    One interesting thing discovered while writing the implementation... Java's WildcardType interface sucks. It allows for an arbitrary number of lower bounds, and an arbitrary number of lower bounds. But in practice, each wildcard has at most a single bound in total (plus Object.class as a the default upper bound). My implementation doesn't support the full range - if ever this becomes necessary (Ie. if the language changes or if I've missed something) we'll write it then. I don't want to write code that I can't test!

    Fixing a critical bug! The following code was broken (although we did have a TODO dating back to sometime last year)
    
      @ImplementedBy(RealFoo.class)
      interface Foo {}
    
      Module fooModule = new AbstractModule() {
        public void configure() {
          bind(Foo.class).in(Scopes.SINGLETON);
        }
      }
    
    The problem was we had a TODO to support scopes on @ProvidedBy and @ImplementedBy that wasn't actually done. This is now fixed. I'm surprised we didn't catch this earlier.

    A few more errors tests. There's only about five left till we have full test coverage for our errors code.
    
    The most interesting error I discovered is that I've regressed since 1.0 and I believe we're now allowing bindings to Injector, whereas previously we were not. I'll fix this shortly.

    Moved Errors (an implementation detail class) out of InjectionPoint (a public API).
    
    Also made allowNullsBadBadBad into a one-time check rather than an everytime check. I hate to make something so terrible more efficient! But the stop-the-world synchronization hurts everyone, and that's bad.

    ProviderMethods are now automatically installed from their module. That means that the following Injector will have "A" bound to the String:
      Guice.createInjector(new AbstractModule() {
        public void configure() { }
        @Provides public String provideString() { return "A"; }
      );
    
    If the user already installed the provider methods for the same module instance, things will still work okay.

    ProviderMethods now works with generic types. It won't work perfectly due to erasure (the provider objects can't have unresolved type parameters) but it should make most generic stuff work as expected.
    
    A future, more interesting change is to make it so we support generic injection points. So we can say  "@Inject List<T> elements" safely.

    Grand unification of commands and SPI:
     - Command is now Element
     - Binding is an Element
     - Message is an Element
     - All other commands are Elements
     - CommandRecorder is now Elements.getElements(Module)
    
    All the Binding subinterfaces are now just visitor targets in Binding.TargetVisitor.
    
    An old copy of the SPI is available in 'spi.oldversion'. This will be removed soon! But it should make migration possible.
    
    An old copy of Commands is not available in this commit. I'm going to add that back in, to make it migration possible.
    
    Still outstanding:
     - Restore a copy of commands to ease migration. This will get killed before 2.0.
     - Kill the oldversion SPI before 2.0
     - Thorough Javadoc
     - Merge BindConstant and Binding
     - Integrate InjectionPoints with Binding

    Removing the check for issue 64. We already blow up when trying to make Class or Constructor's members accessible, via the new private-constructor check.
    
    I attempted to add a test to see whether Guice provides reasonable errors if a SecurityManager is present, but it seems like it's not really worth the effort. Almost everything we do with java.lang.Reflect is going to need reflect access, and handling this gracefully would require wrapping EVERYTHING in try/catch blocks for SecurityException.  We may consider adding a check at the beginning of say, Guice.createInjector to ensure that reflection is available, but I don't think it's critical for the time being.
    
    Also added some tests for requestInjection to make sure errors have the appropriate source lines. We weren't including source lines properly for members added via requestInjection. This is fixed.

    Tweaking error handling.
    
    There was a bug where we weren't handling an ErrorsException that wasn't related to a passed-in Errors object. This Errors approach is good 'cause the messages are good. But it still isn't particularly easy to code against because we need to both pass-in an Errors object and throw an ErrorsException if a return value cannot be computed.
    
    Also changing how error message merging works, so that if we get a problem looking up say, a cached constructor, we use the code that wants that constructor as a source.

    A fix to an unfortunate, rare concurrency problem. During injector creation, it's possbile that an @Inject method will start a thread, and attempt to access injected members while the injector is still being created. The IdentityHashSet of members to inject is currently accessed, and everything blows up. Terrible!
    
    The fix is somewhat involved so I moved it all to a new class, CreationTimeMemberInjector. It takes care of preventing other threads from accessing injected members until all such members have been injected.

    Stuart's fixes for the BytecodeGenTest.
    
    Also changing Classes.isInnerClass to do the modifiers check first. Turns out that by calling Class.getEnclosingClass, we were causing the enclosing class to get loaded. Not really a big deal, but not something we really want to do.
    
    Still to do -- change the code to not use this classloader if any intercepted method is package-private.

    Disallowing private, no arg constructors that don't have @Inject on 'em. This is issue #120. The workaround is to increase the visibility of the constructor (package private still works) or to add @Inject on the constructed type.
    
    Also turning off our classloader stuff until our assistedinject tests pass again. Currently they conflict with the other classloader. This might just be an issue with assistedinject not using Guice's proxy classloader. Regardless, that's kind of lame because it means extensions need to know which classloader to use.

    Massive refactoring to exception handling. I'm trying to simplify things, but they are currently a little bit more complicated. I'll do another round shortly.
    
    The main benefit of this change is that now all of our error handling flows through one class: Errors.java.
    
    It takes care of
     - managing the current source line,
     - managing the current InjectionPoint
     - building Messages
     - toStrings
    
    Because of this refactoring we now use almost exactly the same code for both ProvisionException and CreationException. The consequence of this is that ProvisionExceptions now include a full error report -- all of the classes injected. "Fail fast, but not too fast" now applies to Provide-time as well as Injector-create time.
    
    I also made InjectionPoint into a public class in SPI. It replaces dependency. I like this change because "dependency" is a very abstract name, whereas InjectionPoint is very Guicey.

    Massive refactoring to exception handling. I'm trying to simplify things, but they are currently a little bit more complicated. I'll do another round shortly.
    
    The main benefit of this change is that now all of our error handling flows through one class: Errors.java.
    
    It takes care of
     - managing the current source line,
     - managing the current InjectionPoint
     - building Messages
     - toStrings
    
    Because of this refactoring we now use almost exactly the same code for both ProvisionException and CreationException. The consequence of this is that ProvisionExceptions now include a full error report -- all of the classes injected. "Fail fast, but not too fast" now applies to Provide-time as well as Injector-create time.
    
    I also made InjectionPoint into a public class in SPI. It replaces dependency. I like this change because "dependency" is a very abstract name, whereas InjectionPoint is very Guicey. Guice injects stuff. Dependencies are a consequence of this, but I like the API better exposing the core Guice abstractions directly.
    
    This entire change needs further doc, simplification and cleanup. Todo.

    Refactoring error messages. I changed 'em from public static final constants to methods. The benefit is that now the arguments are typechecked. More importantly, now we can gather coverage on methods. Which opens the door to figuring out which methods we have test coverage for (not very many!)

    OSGi support - we now export OSGi metadata in our manifest.
    
    The tool we're currently using is somewhat crufty. It attempts to parse the .java files to figure out what needs importing and exporting. As a consequence, when we import inner classes, it breaks. For example, it will do the wrong thing if it sees this statement:
      import com.google.inject.InjectorImpl.SingleParameterInjector;
    The alternative is a popular tool called BND. It's what most of the OSGi diehards use, and we might consider switching to it. But it is significantly more complex (it has its own property language) and requires .bnd files for each exported .jar. Regardless, that tool is smarter and if this strategy doesn't work out, we should adopt that tool.

    A bunch of polish fixes for 2.0:
    
    -All built-in Matchers are now Serializable. I needed to convert all anonymous inner classes to named nested classes.
    -Objects.hashCode()
    -Introducing a Types utility class with Serializable ParameterizedType and GenericArrayType implementations. Their hashCodes are consistent with Sun's JDK, although I'm not sure if that means they'll work on other Java SDKs.
    - TypeLiteral Serialization fixups. Sun's Type implementations aren't Serializable, so I do some writeReplace hackery to make it just work.
    - Adding some missing calls to fail() in try/catch tests
    - Introducing the Asserts utility class. I'd like to keep this as lean as possible. Currently it's just the stuff we really need.
    - A new TypeLiteral test that shows a problem where two keys that are functionally the same aren't equal

    A bunch of assorted changes:
    
    Fixing AllTests to include missing tests.
    
    Fixing LineNumbersTest to use the new error message. I'm not sure whether this message is a good choice - we should go over all messages before 2.0.
    
    Fixing a bug in UniqueAnnotations where it was returning the wrong hashCode.
    
    Adding tests that show that we don't wrap user exceptions from Provider instances. This needs fixing before 2.0. These tests fail.
    
    Adding tests for serializing various Guice types. In particular, we definitely want our exception types to serialize properly. I'm not sure what our strategy should be for serializing other types, but it seems like we should support it if doing so isn't too difficult. For example, I think Key should be serializable.

    Fixing the binding order problem. My strategy was to break binding creation into two steps:
     - creating the binding itself
     - "initializing" the binding, ie. validating the bindings dependencies
    
    This CL is a start of something that we could go further on. In particular, we could change the @ProvidedBy etc. bindings to use a BindingImpl.initialize() method uniformly to separate creating the binding from building its dependencies.

    Large internal change:
    
    I've replaced MissingDependencyException with ResolveFailedException, and increased the number of places where it's used. We used to have a lot of code that looked like this:
      if (someBadCondition) {
        addError(whatBadThingHappenedMessage);
        return invalidBinding();
      }
    Now we do something simpler - we just throw a ResolveFailedException:
      if (someBadCondition) {
        throw new ResolveFailedException(whatBadThingHappenedMessage);
      }
    
    The motivation was to fix some seemingly-unrelated logic: optional bindings to providers weren't working. The problem was that the code that was calling 'addError' didn't know that it was an optional binding, and therefore not an error. This change is pretty much the only thing that could fix that problem, so I think it's worthwhile.
    
    As an added treat, the change also fixed 2 of our 3 known test failures:
    1. messaging for injecting  abstract class used to be lame. Now it's good.
    2. we never used to complain when leaving a dangling binding, like so:
      bind(Collection.class).to(List.class);
    Now we get an error when doing the list binding, and this bubbles all the way up as it should.
    
    Since the change is big I suspect there might be some bug fallout. I'm going to run it against my standard test case (a giant application that uses Guice) to see if there's any regressions. Anything that has regressed will get its own testcase in the coming week or so...

    This test demonstrates that Guice falls over itself while trying to load the bytecode for a class it generated itself.
    
    We should be using the constructor of bound class, not the enhanced class, to find the line numbers.
    
    We might also want to make LineNumber resolution more fault-tolerant.

     - duplicate logger binding is no longer a special case check in BindCommandProcessor

    I haven't fixed the bind out-of-order problem, but I have constrainted it to a much more limited set.
    
    The only problem remaining is when:
     - a type is bound with a scope: bind(x).asEagerSingleton()
     - that type is needed in creation of another untargetted binding

    First draft of visitablebinder. This is an alternate implementation of binder() that builds an ADT of the module's bindings, which can be introspected on and manipulated independently of an Injector.

    Removing Objects.nonNull(Object[])
    
    This method was disabled previously, so it wasn't catching any errors.
    
    We still do not inject methods with new values because now those values are caught within the corresponding InternalFactory.

    Introducing the idea of a stack of ExternalContexts.
    
    This means that when we throw an ProvisionException, we can include the entire stack, rather than catching and adding context as necessary.
    
    It also means it's slightly easier to push a new ExternalContext onto the stack.

    Pulled up some anonymous inner classes. Hopefully the CB will be eligible for garbage collection after startup. I'll have to test this theory later.

    Created ContainerCreationException which delivers the error messages to the client. Added performance logging. Validation performance might be a concern. Will keep the design such that we can lazily validate if desired.

    Redesigned scopes to enable custom implementations. Renamed DependencyException to ConfigurationException. Cleaned up Container's interface. It now returns a Factory instead of a direct instance so clients don't have to keep passing in the paramters resulting in a map lookup. Added support for injecting Factory<T> where T is any bound type.
